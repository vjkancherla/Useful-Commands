I have two application, that I deploy to two separate cloud infrastructures.
The apps need each other to work correctly.
App-1
=====
- has a proxy micro-service app
- has a Database
- connects to backend app (App-2)
- the proxy micro-service app can only run correctly after App-2 has started

App-2
======
- has the backend micro-service app
- needs the DB running (part of App-1) to be able to startup

I have run into a problem with some automation I am trying to create.
I trying to auto-deploy both the apps using separate scripts. The URL of each app will change with each deployment.
Each script needs the URL to the other app.
Questions:
How can I make sure that the apps are started corrected, in the correct order?
However Can I reference the URLs in the scripts if they keep changing with each deployment?

PS: I have a fully functioning "defualt" app deployments. Can I temporary leverage this default deployment somehow to mitigate the complexities?
